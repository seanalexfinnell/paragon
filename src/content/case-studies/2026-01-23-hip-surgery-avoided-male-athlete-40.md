title: "Hip Surgery Avoided: male athlete, 40"
---
## **Patient History:** 

Subject was NHL professional hockey player who rapidly developed chronic hip pain.  For more than 4 weeks he had been having difficulty sleeping, could not push when he skated, and was limping when he walked.  He was diagnosed with a torn hip labrum by three different leading hip surgeons.  All three said he needed surgery to correct the painful problem.  Athlete would miss the first half of his season, possibly ending his professional career.

## **Suspected Causes and Recommended Intervention:**

Paragon Director of Research Sam Bock had been coaching this athlete for the past 6 years and disagreed with the surgeons’ diagnosis, as the athlete’s pain was not in the hip but on the very outside of his hip where a number of muscle tendons insert to the hip.  The symptoms he was experiencing were indicative of multiple muscle spasms due to over zealous off season training that had created a debilitating and chronic tendonitis at the affected hip insertions.

## **Results:**

Bock traveled to the athlete’s home for one week of therapy and rehabilitation training.

Day 1: Upon his arrival the athlete could not walk properly, no less skate.  A 15 minute hot bath and 1.5 hour treatment of deep tissue massage immediately located several spasmed muscles, which were then treated with massage, A.R.T., and hip mobility stretching.  This was followed by alternating hot and cold tub treatments to flush the athlete’s tissues and reduce inflammation.  The athlete was finally able to sleep well that night. 

Day 2: After heat treatments/massage, starts therapeutic squat training with just 85 lbs. to re-strengthen atrophied glutes and related skating muscles.  Also does a few other general strength exercises and very light, slow, interval-style skating.  Followed by another hour of massage and stretching, followed by alternating hot and cold treatments.  

Day 3: same process, but with squats to 135lbs., and slightly faster, longer interval skating.  

Day 4: same, w/ squats up to 185 lbs. and faster & longer interval skating than previous session.  

Day 5: rest day from weights, and more skating, which was dramatically improved, with athlete reaching 80-90% of top speed with no pain. 

Day 6: squats to 225 lbs., first light sprints, and longer faster interval skating.  Athlete is now skating effortlessly. 

Day 7: squats up to 285 lbs. squats, sprint drills, and a full out 2 on 2 scrimmage for 20 minutes. 

Athlete resumes normal training at this point, avoids unnecessary surgery, and two years later became the oldest player in NHL history to score two goals in a playoff game.
