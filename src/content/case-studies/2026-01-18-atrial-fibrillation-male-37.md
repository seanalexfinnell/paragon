title: "Atrial Fibrillation: male, 37"
---
## **Patient History:** 

If this individual exercised too hard he would frequently suffer attacks of atrial fibrillation where his heart rate would soar to 200+ bpm and stay there for a minute or longer before the electrical function of his heart would return to normal.   

## **Suspected cause and treatment advised:**

Individual’s poor diet and lack of conditioning were causing several problems.  One, under strenuous exercise, his bloodstream was easily depleted of oxygen.  Second, his intracellular tissues were probably low on magnesium, as his less-than-optimum diet would not provide this.  This could lead to excess intracellular calcium, which would lead to premature atrial contractions, as well as mal-functioning of the magnesium-dependant SA node, which senses oxygen levels in blood returning to the heart. 

When exercising he would push himself too far, further depleting his venous blood of oxygen, thereby causing the SA node to signal the heart to pump rapidly beyond its capacity.  As his heart reached beyond it’s capacity (about 160 bpm) it would suddenly and dramatically loose its ability to pump blood due to the ineffective atrial quivering caused by chaotic conduction of electrical signals through the upper chambers of the heart.  

This would further reduce the flow of oxygen-depleted blood past the SA node, causing the SA node to signal the heart to pump even faster.  During this period of ineffective pumping his heart rate would very rapidly sore to 205-215 bpm and stay there for a minute or two.  After resting, his heart would finally subside from this dangerous, inefficient state as his returning venous blood gradually recovered enough oxygen to allow the SA node to signal the heart to beat more slowly, allowing his heart’s atrial mechanics to return to normal. 

To counter this he was started on gradual exercise, the consumption of omega 3 fatty acids to improve oxygen transport throughout his body, and magnesium aspartate to rebalance intracellular magnesium and reduce intracellular calcium, necessary to prevent premature atrial contractions and mal-functioning of the SA node.

## **Results:** 

Palpitations and arrhythmia were much better immediately.  Within 3 weeks significant improvement was achieved while exercising due to improved blood oxygen levels that resulted from omega 3 supplementation and more efficient use of oxygen by his muscle cells due to nutrition & exercise program.  The arrhythmia was fully eliminated within 6 weeks.
