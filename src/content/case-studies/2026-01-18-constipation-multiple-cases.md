title: "Constipation: multiple cases"
---
## **Typical Patient History:** 

The person is most often not drinking enough water, lacking magnesium required for proper bowel muscle function, and/or lacking essential fatty acids necessary to soften the stool.  The patient may also not be eating enough vegetables, other fiber, and eating too much bread, meat & cheese.

## **Treatment Advised:**

Use HTMA to determine whether an absolute or relative magnesium deficiency is present.  Use patient interview or fatty acid testing results to assess overall fatty acid and fiber intake, and adjust diet and food intake accordingly.  Ensure adequate hydration.
