title: "Fully Impacted Bowel: male, 74"
---
## **Patient History:** 

Bock and Paragon are asked to intervene on behalf of a terminal liver cancer patient hospitalized with a severely impacted ascending colon.  Patient has not passed any solid stool in more than 8 weeks, and has not been able to eat solids.  Despite the patient’s previous complaints, the impaction is only discovered after an attending physician orders an x-ray to determine the cause of a large hardened mass on the patient’s lower right side that is noticed when addressing the patient’s repeated complaint.  The x-ray reveals a very large fecal mass stuck in the ascending colon.  For the next 10 days the medical team then tries all conventional methods to get the obstruction to move, but with no success.  The attending team believes the patient’s colon has suffered nerve damage from previous drug therapy used to recently treat acute pancreatitis.  They are now getting ready to surgically remove the mass from the patient. 

## **Intervention:**

Paragon offers the medical team an alternative intervention based on its analysis of the patient.  Paragon deduces that prior & massive antibiotic infusions used to treat the acute pancreatitis have likely killed all beneficial flora in the bowel necessary to make normal stool.  Paragon further suggests the involuntary muscle within the patient’s colon is not necessarily damaged, but dehydrated, physically and nutritionally exhausted, and as a result, no longer able to contract effectively to move the hardened enlarged mass.                

Paragon develops an intervention to (1) replenish nutrients & rehydration to the colon, (2) provide probiotic to help digest the impacted fecal matter and build healthy stool, and (3) provide lubrication to help move the mass along, while fully taking into account the patient’s liver cancer, recent acute pancreatic infection, and enhanced potential for recurring bacterial infection.

The intervention provides the patient with sources of high-calorie, dense nutrition for the first time in over 8 weeks — it’s high oil content to not only provides lubrication to move dried, impacted fecal masses out, but to provide high energy, oxygen-uptake-enhancing oils to the body and colon tissue as well. 

**The protocol uses:** _(list does not indicate order of importance)_

*   probiotic to help digest the impacted debris (as demonstrated in recent medical research)
    
*   therapeutic doses of magnesium citrate taken w/ lightly salted water — to fuel and relax the spasmed bowel muscle, and to draw critical water into the colon to soften the impacted debris and provide fluid to help push it out (would normally have used Magnesium Asporotates, however none were available locally)
    
*   L-carnitine & digestive enzyme, to ensure that colon and other cells can absorb and use the oil for fuel (required for high energy aerobic beta oxidation of fats within cells)
    
*   flax oil: to provide lubrication, oxygen enhancing omega 3s, fuel, and fatty acids for cellular repair; and for rebuilding of red blood cells (patient’s RBC count has been dramatically reduced by chemo treatment)
    
*   olive oil to provide lubrication, energy, and taste
    
*   green vegetable juices: nutrient rich super food to provide nutrients for hemoglobin synthesis, alkalizing mineral and necessary vitamins for normal  liver, pancreatic, and other cellular function
    
*   vegetable soups: to provide protein; healthy oil to fuel cells & rebuild tissues; and limited amounts of complex sugar that can be slowly digested to provide fuel for the brain without feeding cancer cells
    
*   Co-enzyme B vitamin food complex and NAD (activated Vitamin B3): to provide vitamins required to restart aerobic respiration in cells with cancer or cells with acidosis approaching cancer
    
*   CoQ10: also to provide vitamin required to restart aerobic respiration in cells with cancer or acidosis approaching cancer
    
*   ALA / ALCAR to also provide vitamin required to restart aerobic respiration
    
*   Oral Saltwater Enema flushes to purge digestive system from top to bottom
    
*   calcium carbonate, should the patient initially have trouble falling to sleep at night
    
*   Subsequently, if the bowel opens up, ground flax seed (rich in fiber and Omega 3 oil) to be added to cereals and diet, to improve elimination and enhance oxygen transport necessary to fight cancer, virus, and pathogenic bacteria.  
    

**Basic strategy:**

1.  Draw fluids into the dehydrated colon with magnesium, salt, and water — to soften impacted mass, provide lubrication, and create hydraulic pressure to move the fecal mass
    
2.  Provide abundant additional oil lubrication between fecal mass and colon wall by providing frequent doses of slippery flax and olive oils.  This lubrication to be achieved by exceeding intestinal potential for absorption, allowing excess oil to travel directly to the colon to provide physical lubrication
    
3.  Aid bacterial digestion of impacted mass with probiotic.  Repopulate bowel with healthy bacteria necessary for normal stool formation & bulk
    
4.  Lightly massage affected area of bowel 2-3 times per day to help breakup and stimulate movement of impacted mass
    
5.  Do light hip swivels and gentle gut mobility and stretching to stimulate movement of water, oils, and impacted food through bowel
    
6.  Flush system regularly with gentle but effective oral saltwater hydraulic purge until impacted solids are removed
    
7.  Enhance and ensure adequate intestinal and cellular absorption of easily-digested, energy-rich, healthy oils — using L-carnitine and digestive enzyme — to power colon action and to provide the rest of the patient’s muscles and organs with energy to function
    
8.  Gradually and continually sip alkalizing juices, soups, and water — to: optimize bile and pancreatic function & digestion, keep circulating sugar levels low and constant to help reverse acidosis and cancer, but still provide a trickle of sugar to the brain and adrenal medulla; prevent hypoglycemia capable of wasting muscle mass; and provide protein and fats necessary to rebuild and/or replicate cells.
    
9.  Absolutely avoid rapid consumption of juice or soups - sip only to prevent any surges of blood sugar capable of feeding just cancer cells.
    
10.  Use magnesium, B vitamins and juice to help reduce anxiety.  Add calcium carbonate to the mix if patient is edgy or feeling too hyper from ingestion of salt water.
    
11.  Get extra rest to allow bowel and other cells to alkalize and re-energize.
    
12.  Consider supplemental lipase in addition to that found in digestive enzyme if patient’s ability to digest oils seems to be a problem.
    

## **Results:**

Within 36 hours the patient moves and eliminates enormous amounts of matter (over the course of two prolonged movements), and his bowel resumes function.
