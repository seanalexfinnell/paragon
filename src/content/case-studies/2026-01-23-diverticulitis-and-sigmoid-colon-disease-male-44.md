title: "Diverticulitis & Sigmoid Colon Disease: male, 44"
---
## **Patient History:** 

The patient was a former NHL hockey player who was in tremendous physical shape and trained vigorously most days.  However he had developed recurring diverticular disease.  Diverticulitis develops from diverticulosis, which involves the formation of pouches (diverticula) on the outside of the colon.  Diverticulitis results if one of these diverticula becomes inflamed.  

The patient had five episodes of Diverticulitis in a three year period, and was experiencing intense pain followed by explosive diarrhea.  Three of the episodes required hospitalization.  After the last period of hospitalization, the patient’s GP indicated that the only way to solve this recurring problem was through surgery.  He referred the patient to a colorectal surgeon who, after several examinations and numerous tests, agreed that a sigmoid colon resection was the only answer.  A friend of his suggested that he contact Paragon about alternative solutions.

## **Suspected Causes and Interventions:** 

The patient interview revealed that in addition to poor dietary habits, he was playing evening hockey, and then having a few beers with team-mates after the game.  

The poor diet and intense exercise followed by beer was causing several problems: (1) a dehydration from sweating and alcohol, and (2) a depletion of magnesium required for involuntary smooth colonic muscle function that together were causing constipation.  Skeletal muscle required for sport, and the metabolism of refined carbohydrates like beer, both require magnesium.  This was leading to a lack of magnesium required for normal colonic muscle function.   (3) The beer after playing was also feeding intestinal bacteria that were generating a build up of gas that was becoming trapped between the constipated meals / bowel movements within the colon at a given time.  That gas pressure was leading to the formation of diverticula, which were becoming infected with pathogenic bacteria. 

Temporary elimination of problem sugars and alcohol would be needed to reduce the generation of pathogenic bacteria in the gut.  Additional magnesium would be required to reestablish proper colon function.  Balanced  consumption of essential fatty acids, and other beneficial nutrients would be required to heal the colon, and to ensure the formation of normal softer stools.

## **Results:** 

Upon colorectal examination 5 weeks later there was no sign of any diverticular disease.  The dietary changes prescribed have since become part of the patient’s everyday living.  Twelve years later there have been no issues, and the patient continues to pursue his very active athletic lifestyle with more energy than he had previously.
