title: "Chronic Fatigue & other problems: female, 37"
---
## **Patient History:** 

Patient was experiencing chronic fatigue, low blood pressure, little skin eruptions, sporadic asthma, and cardiac arrhythmia.  

## **Suspected cause and interventions:**

The patient interview revealed excessive consumption of cheese, and large predator fish like swordfish and tuna.  Her Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis (HTMA) also showed very high tissue levels of calcium & copper, and low levels of potassium, magnesium, iron, manganese, and zinc, all of which contribute to lowered metabolic rate and fatigue.  HTMA also showed highly elevated mercury, most likely from contaminated fish oils from sword fish, tuna, and EPA / DHA supplements.  Mercury contamination interferes with heme oxygen transport, causing fatigue and other problems.  It can also contribute to skin eruptions as the body works to clear itself through the skin’s pores.  Fortunately the patient was not yet showing any neurological symptoms associated with acute mercury toxicity.

The HTMA results explained why she suffering from fatigue and had significantly slowed metabolism.  This patient’s love of cheese and dairy were causing potassium and magnesium deficiencies — slowing metabolism and causing collection of copper.  As well her clinical HTMA profile indicated potential for hypoglycemia, low blood pressure, and irregular heartbeat, as well as copper related anemia, skin problems, and food allergies.  Magnesium deficiency often contributes to asthma as well.

The patient was given dietary and supplement recommendations to improve her metabolic state.  She was advised to continue to get regular easy/moderate exercise (3-5 times per week 20-30min), and to keep her lymph system clean and moving with moderate exercise while she was eliminating the mercury that has been collecting for many years.

## **Results:** 

Within weeks she began to notice significantly increased energy levels, reduction of skin problems, and overall improvement in her health. 5 years later, at age 42 this patient gave birth to a healthy 7 pound boy.
