title: "Permanent Paralysis & Stroke Damage: female, 39"
---
## **Patient History:** 

The patient was a young, overweight, single, mother of three who had suffered a stroke, been left paralyzed on her left side, and was in a wheel chair.  No progress or recovery of lost neurological function had been seen in more than 10 weeks since the stroke.  The patient’s family was told by the attending neurological team to expect permanent paralysis of the left side.   

This patient was in the same rehabilitation hospital as the previous paralysis patient (discussed directly above) and had seen that patient make an unexpected recovery.  Her family members asked if Paragon could help her recover.   

Initially we were not sure we could help this patient for several reasons:  One, we were not technically responsible for that patient, as her care was being provided by the province and was out of our hands.

Second, Paragon did not have the ability to provide the comprehensive metabolic testing the previous patient had had to generate his comprehensive formula.  Nor could she afford to have such a comprehensive formula made, as she was very poor.  

Third and more problematic, in most stroke cases if a patient is to recover lost function, usually some signs of recovery, no matter how small are seen with 5 -14 days.  This patient had shown absolutely no sign of recovery for 10 weeks.   

Fourth, and equally problematic was the patient’s heavy dose of warfarin used to control her abnormal blood platelet aggregation which had initially led to her stroke.  As her platelet function was only being monitored once a week at the hospital, this meant the family would need to limit the amount of any supplemental omega 3 fatty acids they might provide in meals brought to the patient, as Omega 3s reduce platelet aggregation, and might push the patient’s INR too high, possibly causing bleeding.  As such, given these circumstances the treatment options that could be used (1) safely and (2) within the regulations of the hospital were very limited.  

Regardless, Paragon has a policy of trying to help those less fortunate if at all possible.  So we met with the family and explained the limitations faced, and tried to work out a plan.  

## **Intervention advised**: 

It was not realistic to expect the attending medical team to approve Paragon’s recently developed neuro-regenerative protocol, as it was experimental and derived from an analysis of a compilation of related peer-reviewed research found by Paragon’s research team on behalf of the previous patient.  Rather than unnecessarily upset the attending medical staff, we suggested the family consider providing a simple OTC supplementation of the patient’s hospital food — a very good multi vitamin and mineral tablet, just 500mg of Krill oil (so as not to cause a rapid & sharp drop in platelet aggregation and a corresponding increase in INR), flax oil, and high quality bio-available magnesium to ease potential for muscle spasticity.  As the patient had been paralyzed with no improvement for so long, and this simple intervention was not the comprehensive formula she probably needed to optimize biochemical function and healing, we did not realistically think it would have a significant effect.  However, we did not overly emphasize that when speaking with the patient, as quelling her positive spirit would only be counter-productive.  Instead we cautioned the family and patient not to get their hopes up too much, but that those added nutrients might possibly help.

## **Results:** 

Surprisingly, 3 weeks later the patient’s leg began to move.  Another 3 weeks later she was up and walking with a cane.  While no function returned to her paralyzed arm, she is no longer in a wheel chair, can take care of herself, and enjoys dancing and life again.
