title: "Cranial Bacterial Infection: female, 17"
---
## **Patient History:** 

Patient was suffering from intense headaches, debilitating insomnia, and chronic fatigue.   The headaches were so severe that she had to quit school for several months and was confined to bed for 10-13 hours per day, although she was unable to sleep for more than a few hours at any given time.  Any cerebral activity such as reading or computer use would trigger the headaches.  

A battery of tests were performed by various specialists, as her mother worked in the pharmaceutical industry and had access to all the best care.  However, the only conventional medical intervention that provided any relief from the headaches were antibiotic treatments.  Yet as soon as the antibiotics were discontinued the headaches would return. 

## **Suspected Causes and Recommended Interventions:**

The fact that the antibiotic worked, albeit temporarily, indicated that her condition was at least in part bacterial in nature, even though the only sites of bacterial infection appeared to be somewhere in her cranial cavity, and in her mouth (14 new dental carries after never having any).  Bacterial infections often are caused by excess consumption of simple or refined sugars. 

An in-depth patient interview revealed that her extremely poor diet contained a very high percentage of refined sugar and transfatty acids.  

Paragon recommended an initial HTMA to determine other potential dietary and related metabolic issues.  The report from the intracellular tissue analysis predicted most of her symptoms, indicated severe potassium and magnesium deficiencies, a relative zinc deficiency (all which were missed by her blood tests), as well as several other mineral and vitamin imbalances.  These were addressed with a mix of synergistic supplements, EFAs, and dietary changes.

Achieving the dietary changes involved teaching this young person how to eat properly for the first time.   

Further, to monitor the effects of these dietary changes on her condition, she was instructed to keep a log, and to email it to be reviewed by Paragon’s research team at least once a week.

## **Results:** 

Fully recovered by 8 weeks:  Sleep began to normalize immediately.  Within 2 weeks the headaches were gone.  Began part-time return to school within 6 weeks.  Began swimming training.  Took summer job as lifeguard.  Re-enrolled in school the following semester.
