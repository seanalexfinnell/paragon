---
## **Patient History:** 

Patient had developed a painful advanced case of mosaic planter-type in his two feet.  OTC remedies, repeated freezings, and an experimental anti-viral prescription drug therapy had all failed to alleviate the problem.  The patient had between 25-30 warts with deep roots on each foot.  The patient was also suffering from low energy, arrhythmia, and muscle cramping. 

## **Suspected cause and intervention advised**: 

The human papillomavirus causes warts.  All viruses require low oxygen environments to thrive.  Dietary and lifestyle analysis indicated the viral problem was probably due to a lack of oxygen and other nutrients required to enhance immune system strength.  This low oxygen was contributing to the arrhythmia as well.  In addition to a stressful executive lifestyle, he ate a lot of meat rich in growth and inflammation promoting Omega 6 fatty acids and had very little omega 3 fatty acid intake form fish flax or other sources.   

The patient began using fresh organic flax oil (necessary to increase oxygen transport, absorption & utilization within the body), and taking a full range of supplemental vitamins and minerals the analysis indicated would beneficial to his case.  

## **Results:** 

Over a six week period all the warts gradually disappeared.  The subject also had increased energy, and relief from previously cramping muscles, and no longer had any arrhythmia.
